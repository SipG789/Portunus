Storage of my portfolio work 

* As a developer, I want to have a website where I can store all of the projects I have been working on. 

## Introduction 

*  This webpage is designed for me, by me, here you can see my previous work. The hope is that while I keep working as a developer I can return to this page and add more to it and enhance it. 

* I used HTML and CSS for this project. I tried my best to work with the knowledge that I have learned throughout this course. You may notice that I used the code from my Run-Buddy project as a guideline for much of the CSS. It is still new to me and having an exemplar was very helpful for me. 

* I had to also do research in order to add features that I personally wanted.

WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
